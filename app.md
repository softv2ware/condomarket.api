## What is CondoMarket?

CondoMarket is a **hyperlocal marketplace platform** designed exclusively for apartment buildings, condominiums, and residential communities. Think of it as a private marketplace where neighbors can buy, sell, and trade products and services within their building or complex.

## The Problem We Solve

Living in apartment buildings presents unique opportunities and challenges:

- **Trust Issues**: Buying from strangers online can be risky
- **Convenience**: Why travel far when your neighbor might have what you need?
- **Community Building**: Neighbors rarely interact or know each other's skills
- **Wasted Resources**: Items sit unused while someone nearby might need them
- **Service Discovery**: Finding reliable help for quick tasks is difficult

## Our Solution

CondoMarket creates **private, building-specific marketplaces** where verified residents can:

### 🛍️ Buy & Sell Products
- Furniture you no longer need
- Electronics and gadgets
- Children's toys and clothes
- Books, games, and hobby items
- Appliances and home goods

### 🔧 Offer & Book Services
- Handyman services
- Tutoring and lessons
- Pet sitting and dog walking
- House cleaning
- Tech support
- Photography
- And much more!
